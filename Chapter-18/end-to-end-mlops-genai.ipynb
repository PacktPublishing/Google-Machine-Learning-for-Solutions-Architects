    "In this notebook, we will build end-to-end event-driven solution that combines MLOps & Gen AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will focus on a computer vision (CV) use case to identify objects in images. Extending the CV use case we implemented in Chapter 15, we will build our CV model via an MLOps pipeline that incorporates the majority of the main topics from the earlier chapters in this book, such as data preparation, model training, deployment, inference, and evaluation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The novel approach we are using here is to utilize generative AI to generate the data that will be used to test and evaluate our model. "

    "## Solution Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin with the MLOps pipeline architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MLOps pipeline architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is the architecture of the MLOps pipeline we will build in this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "![MLOps](images/cpt-18-mlops-pipeline.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the MLOps pipeline, the process works as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first step in our pipeline—the model training step—is invoked. While the MLOps pipeline we built for our tabular Titanic dataset in Chapter 11 started with distinct data preprocessing steps using Serverless Spark in Dataproc, in our pipeline in this chapter, the data ingestion and preparation steps are handled directly in the code of our model training job. Also, as noted, in this case, we are using the built-in CIFAR-10 image dataset in Tensorflow/Keras rather than fetching a dataset from an external source. Vertex AI Pipelines starts the model training process by submitting a model training job to the Vertex AI Training service.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. In order to execute our custom training job, the Vertex AI Training service fetches our custom Docker container from Google Artifact Registry. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. When our model has been trained, the trained model artifacts are saved in Google Cloud Storage.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The model training job status is complete.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The next step in our pipeline—the model import step—is invoked. This is an intermediate step that prepares the model metadata to be referenced in later components of our pipeline. The relevant metadata in this case consists of the location of the model artifacts in Google Cloud Storage and the specification of the Docker container image in Google Artifact Registry that will be used to serve our model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The next step in our pipeline—the model upload step—is invoked. This step references the metadata from the model import step.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The model metadata is used to register the model in Vertex AI Model Registry. This makes it easy to deploy our model for serving traffic in Vertex AI.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The model upload job status is complete.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The next step in our pipeline—the endpoint creation step—is invoked.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. An endpoint is created in the Vertex AI Prediction service. This endpoint will be used to host our model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The endpoint creation job status is complete.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The next step in our pipeline - the model deployment step - is invoked.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Our model is deployed to our endpoint in the Vertex AI Prediction service. This step references the metadata of the endpoint that has just been created by our pipeline, as well as the metadata of our model in the Vertex AI Model Registry.   \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The model deployment job status is complete.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### End-to-end solution architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution architecture is shown in the following diagram:\n",
    "\n",
    "![end-to-end](images/cpt-18-end-to-end.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our MLOps pipeline is simplified in the top-left corner of the diagram. It still implements all of the same steps we discussed in the previous section, but the diagram is simplified so we can focus our discussion on the broader, end-to-end solution. In this context, the MLOps pipeline is represented as a single step in the overall process. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following set of steps describes the architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Our MLOps pipeline trains and deploys our CV model. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. When the MLOps pipeline completes, it publishes a message to a Pub/Sub topic we created for that purpose. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Eventarc detects that a message has been published to the Pub/Sub topic. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Eventarc triggers the Cloud Function we’ve created to generate an image. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The code in our image generation function makes a call to the Imagen API with a prompt to generate an image containing one of the types of objects our model was trained to recognize (i.e., a type of object supported by the CIFAR-10 dataset). \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Imagen generates an image and returns it to our function. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Our function stores the new image in GCS. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. GCS emits an event indicating that a new object has been uploaded to our bucket. Eventarc detects this event. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Eventarc invokes our next Cloud Function and passes the GCS event metadata to our function. This metadata includes details such as the identifiers of the bucket and the object in question. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Our prediction function takes the details regarding the bucket and the object in question from the event metadata and uses those details to fetch the newly created object (i.e., the newly generated image from Imagen). \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Our prediction function then performs some preprocessing on the image to transform it into a format that is expected by our model (i.e., similar to the format of the CIFAR-10 data the model was trained on). Our function then sends the transformed data as a prediction request to the Vertex AI endpoint that hosts our model. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Our model predicts what type of object is in the image, and sends a prediction response to our Cloud Function. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Our Cloud Function saves the prediction response in GCS. \n",
    "\n",
    "When the process has been completed, you can view the generated image and the resulting prediction from our model in GCS. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that all of the steps in the solution are implemented automatically and without the need to provision any servers. This is a fully serverless, event-driven solution architecture. \n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting side-effect of this solution is that, although the primary intention is to test our newly trained model on generated data, this solution could also be applied to the inverse use case. That is, if we are confident that our model has been trained effectively and provides consistently accurate results, we could use it to evaluate the quality of the generated data. For example, if our model predicts that the generated data contains a particular type of object with a probability of 99.8%, we can interpret this as a reflection of the quality of the generated data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we’ve discussed the various steps in the process, let’s start building it! "
