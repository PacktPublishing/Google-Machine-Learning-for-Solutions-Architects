    "## Background / overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will build a RAG implementation piece by piece on Vertex AI. There are many different ways to do this. In Chapter 17, we implemented a RAG solution using Vertex AI Search. Remember what we've mentioned numerous times throughout this book: When there are multiple potential ways of implementing a solution, a solution architecture best practice is to always use the most managed solution possible that meets yourn technical and business needs (which may include cost, but that cost should always be considered in terms of \"total cost of ownership\" (TCO), which includes the toil of building and managing solutions ourselves). \n",
    "\n",
    "For that reason, when implementing a RAG solution in Vertex AI, I recommend starting with Vertex AI Search, as we did in Chapter 17. However, if you want to build your own RAG solution from scratch, in which you perform document chunking and embedding explicitly yourself, you can use services such as Google Cloud Document AI and Vertex AI Vector Search (among others)."

    "## Solution Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution architecture is shown in the following diagram:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/RAG-Vertex.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps in the diagram are described as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Our documents, which are stored in Google Cloud Storage (GCS), are sent to Google Cloud Document AI for chunking. As the name suggests, the chunking process breaks the documents into “chunks,” which are smaller sections of the document. This is required in order to create standard-sized chunks that serve as inputs to the embedding process. The size of the chunks is configurable in Document AI, and further details on this process are described in the Jupyter Notebook. \n",
    "2. The chunks are then sent to the Google Cloud “textembedding-gecko” LLM to create embeddings for the chunks. The resulting embeddings are stored in GCS, alongside their respective chunks (this step is omitted from the diagram).\n",
    "3. We create a Vertex AI Vector Search index, and the embeddings are ingested from GCS to the Vertex AI Vector Search index (the GCS intermediary step is omitted from the diagram).\n",
    "4. Next, the application/user asks a question that relates to the contents of our documents. The question is sent as a query to textembedding-gecko to be embedded/vectorized.\n",
    "5. The vectorized query is then used as an input in a request to Vertex AI Vector Search, which searches our index to find similar embeddings. Remember that the embeddings represent an element of semantic meaning, so similar embeddings have similar meanings. This is how we can perform a semantic search to find embeddings that are similar to our query.\n",
    "6. Next, we take the embeddings returned from our Vertex AI Vector Search query and find the chunks in GCS that relate to those embeddings (remember that Step 2 in our solution created a stored association of chunks and embeddings).\n",
    "7. Now, it’s finally time to send a prompt to Gemini. The retrieved document chunks from Step 6 serve as context for the prompt. This helps Gemini to respond to our prompt based on the relevant contents from our documents and not just from its pre-trained knowledge.\n",
    "8. Gemini responds to the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, between some of the steps depicted in the diagram, Google Cloud Storage is used to store the inputs and outputs of each step, but those intermediary processes are omitted to make the diagram more readable. Also, when we implement this solution here in our Jupyter Notebook, the notebook is the “application/user” that coordinates each of the steps in the overall process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, in this case, we are using documents stored in GCS as our source of truth, but we could also use other data, such as data stored in BigQuery."

    "### Notes on tokens and chunks\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs generally work with `tokens` rather than words. When dealing with text, a token often represents subsections of words, and tokenization can be done in different ways, such as breaking text up by characters, or using subword-based tokenization (e.g., the word \"unbelievable\" could be split into subwords such as \"un\", \"believe\", \"able\").\n",
    "\n",
    "The exact size and definition of a token can vary based on different tokenization methods, models, languages, and other factors, but a general rule of thumb for English text using subword tokenizers is around 4 characters per token on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Chunks\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating embeddings, we usually break a document into chunks and then create embeddings of those chunks. Again, this can be done in different ways, using different tools. In this notebook, we're using Google Cloud Document AI to break our documents into chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this purpose, one of the parameters we need to specify for our Document AI Processor is the `chunkSize` to use, which is measured (in this case) by number of tokens per chunk. You may need to experiment with the value for this parameter to find the chunk size that works best for your use case (e.g., based on the length and structure of the document sections). You generally want your chunks to capture some level of semantic granularity, but there are trade-offs in terms of this granularity. For example, smaller chunks can capture more granular sematic context, and can provide more precise search results, but can be less efficient (computationally) to process. You also need to ensure chunks sizes are within the input length limits of the embedding model you're using in order to avoid possible truncation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good practice is to start with a moderate chunk size and adjust it based on how well it fits your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, Document AI can automatically handle some chunking based on layout, even without a set chunkSize, so that can be helpful if you don't know what chunk size to use."
