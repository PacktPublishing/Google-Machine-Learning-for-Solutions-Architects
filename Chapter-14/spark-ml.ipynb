    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will build a pipeline that will perform the following steps:\n",
    "1. Custom data processing such as feature scaling, one-hot encoding, and feature engineering, in a Google Cloud Serverless Spark environment.\n",
    "2. Implement a custom training job in Vertex AI to train a custom model. In this case, our model uses the [Titanic dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data) to predict the likelihood of survival of each passenger based on their associated features in the dataset.\n",
    "3. Upload the trained model to Vertex AI Model Registry.\n",
    "4. Deploy the trained model to a Vertex AI endpoint for online inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this initial section, we set up all of the baseline requirements to run our pipeline."
